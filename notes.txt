Main Goals:
    Small scale life evolution sim using particles
    Particles exert forces on other particles
    Particles can form bonds and create molecules
    Particles can affect the state of other particles (metabolism)

    Simplify common cell structures as single particles

Mechanics:
    Particles are spawned based on input parameters
    Their interactions can be customized
    Particles can bond based on charge
    Energy is stored as either vibration or rotation
    Colliding particles either bond, or transfer energy

TODO:
    UI with controls for setting particle spawn numbers
    Particle interaction function
        Process each type of particle with relation to each other type 
        Bounce off of walls
    Ability to select a particle or molecule to see info
